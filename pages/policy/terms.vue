            These Terms, including the Napricot online Terms and Conditions of
            Use and Privacy Policy and any other policies or agreements
            expressly incorporated by reference therein, constitutes the entire
            agreement between you and Napricot in relation to the Content you're
            licensing. If a court finds any provision of these Terms to be
            unreasonable or unenforceable in any respect, you agree that these
            Terms will nonetheless be enforced to the maximum extent to which
            they are found by the court to be legally enforceable.
          </li>
          <li>
            These Terms will be governed by applicable federal law and the laws
            of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, without reference to its
            choice of law rules. Nothing herein will be interpreted as a waiver
            of Napricot's rights to the Content under federal and state common
            law and statutes (such as rights of public domain and fair use).

        <p>Mobile Message Service Terms and Conditions</p>
        <p>
          Napricot mobile message service (the "Service") is operated by The
          Napricot Company ("Napricot Company", "we", or "us"). Your use of the
          Service constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions
          ("Mobile Terms"). We may modify or cancel the Service or any of its
          features without notice. To the extent permitted by applicable law, we
          may also modify these Mobile Terms at any time and your continued use
          of the Service following the effective date of any such changes shall
          constitute your acceptance of such changes.
        </p>
        <p>
          By consenting to Napricot's SMS/text messaging service, you agree to
          receive recurring SMS/text messages from and on behalf of Napricot
          through your wireless provider to the mobile number you provided, even
          if your mobile number is registered on any state or federal Do Not
          Call list. Text messages may be sent using an automatic telephone
          dialing system or other technology. Service-related messages may
          include updates, alerts, and information (e.g., order updates, account
          alerts, etc.). Promotional messages may include promotions, specials,
          and other marketing offers (e.g., cart reminders).
        </p>
        <p>
          You understand that you do not have to sign up for this program in
          order to make any purchases, and your consent is not a condition of
          any purchase with Napricot. Your participation in this program is
          completely voluntary.
        </p>
        <p>
          We do not charge for the Service, but you are responsible for all
          charges and fees associated with text messaging imposed by your
          wireless provider. Message frequency varies. Message and data rates
          may apply. Check your mobile plan and contact your wireless provider
          for details. You are solely responsible for all charges related to
          SMS/text messages, including charges from your wireless provider.
        </p>
        <p>
          You may opt-out of the Service at any time. Text the single keyword
          command STOP to +1 (888) 495-5398 or click the unsubscribe link (where
          available) in any text message to cancel. You'll receive a one-time
          opt-out confirmation text message. No further messages will be sent to
          your mobile device, unless initiated by you. If you have subscribed to
          other Napricot mobile message programs and wish to cancel, except
          where applicable law requires otherwise, you will need to opt out
          separately from those programs by following the instructions provided
          in their respective mobile terms. For Service support or assistance,
          email <a>support@napricot.com</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may change any short code or telephone number we use to operate the
          Service at any time and will notify you of these changes. You
          acknowledge that any messages, including any STOP or HELP requests,
          you send to a short code or telephone number we have changed may not
          be received and we will not be responsible for honoring requests made
          in such messages.
        </p>
        <p>
          The wireless carriers supported by the Service are not liable for
          delayed or undelivered messages. You agree to provide us with a valid
          mobile number. If you get a new mobile number, you will need to sign
          up for the program with your new number.
        </p>
        <p>
          To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree that we will not
          be liable for failed, delayed, or misdirected delivery of any
          information sent through the Service, any errors in such information,
          and/or any action you may or may not take in reliance on the
          information or Service.
